# Python-Enigma-Machine
It's an Enigma Machine I made in python. It's not perfect, but I'm proud of it.
So basically just put it in a compiler, make sure that the rotors.txt is with it cause otherwise, guess what? It breaks. A lot.
The rotors go right to left like the original. Like this:
          R "5" "4" "3" "2" "1"
And the plug board is used by inputting the lowercase letters, specifically two at a time.
